## About 
SlimeWarz is an one-on-one board game like [Reversi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reversi) or [Ataxx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ataxx) but has slightly different rules.
You can play with a friend on the same device (Hot Seat!).
Trap your opponent’s slimes among yours to beat them. 
Have fun seeing the slimes turn and change sides (colours) dozens of times, 
while you give battle for conquering the board.
You’re the winner if you got the more slimes when no more slimes can be played. 

## Main features 
* Turn based, 2 player mode supported, 7 x 7 board game 
* Developed with OOP such as Observer pattern, minimized coupling between classes
* Developed MVVM pattern by dividing view, viewModel, and model packages
* Challenge your friends on the same device (2 player mode)

## Play Sequence 
1. One players will be a red slimes and another will be a blue slimes. 
2. When the first player selects a red slime, the game shows available cells nearby the selected slime that can move or copy.
3. The slime will be duplicated when you click one distance empty cell. Otherwise, your slime will be moved to any available cell. 
4. If neighbour slimes are blue (opponents’ slime), they will be consumed and will become red slimes.
5. Use diverse strategies to beat opponents' slime.
